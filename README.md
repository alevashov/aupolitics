Australian politics research, based on Twitter

There are 3 scripts (R files) at the moment, listed below in the order required to run

1. data-collection.R - scrapping Australian parlament website for data of Members of Parlaments (MPs)
2. tweets-collection.R - collecting tweets from MPs
3. analysis.R - analysis of data

Note that analysis.R at the moment uses objects from R memory, so has to be run in the same session with tweet-collection.R
